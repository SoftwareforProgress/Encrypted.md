# üîê Encrypted.md

**Encrypted.md** is a minimalist, local-first Markdown note-taking app with end-to-end encryption by default. Built with [Go](https://golang.org) and [Wails](https://wails.io), it helps developers, educators, organizers, and advocates keep their sensitive notes secure ‚Äî without sacrificing usability.

This project is maintained by the [Software for Progress Foundation](https://softwareforprogress.org), a nonprofit dedicated to advancing Open Source software for accessibility, education, and security.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
